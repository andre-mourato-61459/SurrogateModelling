## [International Journal for Numerical Methods in Biomedical Engineering](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20407947)
Scope: All differential equation based models for biomedical applications and their novel solutions (using either established numerical methods such as finite difference, finite element and finite volume methods or new numerical methods) are within the scope of this journal. Manuscripts with experimental and analytical themes are also welcome if a component of the paper deals with numerical methods. Special cases that may not involve differential equations such as image processing, meshing and artificial intelligence are within the scope. Any research that is broadly linked to the wellbeing of the human body, either directly or indirectly, is also within the scope of this journal.
